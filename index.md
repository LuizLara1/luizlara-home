## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="{{page.imecc}}">IMECC</a>, <a href="{{page.unicamp}}">Unicamp</a>, Br. My current research is divided into two fronts: the first one is summarized in the study of the Ginzburg-Landau functional on compact KÃ¤hler manifolds in higher dimensions, while the second one consists of investigating the behavior of the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on homogeneous spaces, hopefully using Machine Learning techniques.  

## Research Interests

- **Differential Geometry:** gauge theory, spectral geometry, homogeneous spaces. 
- **Machine Learning:** ML methods in Lie theory and spectral theory.
