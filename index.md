## About Me

I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="{{page.imecc}}">IMECC</a>, <a href="{{page.unicamp}}">Unicamp</a>, Brazil.

I am a researcher in differential and algebraic geometry. My work primarily focuses on gauge theory, with a particular interest in variational aspects of the Yang–Mills–Higgs functional.


I also study the construction of Bridgeland stable vector bundles associated with solutions to the deformed Hermitian–Yang–Mills equation.

## Research Interests

- **Differential Geometry:** gauge theory, variational calculus, geometric analysis. 
- **Algebraic Geometry:** stability conditions, constructions of stable sheaves.

## News
The preview version of my PhD Thesis is now available! 

[comment]: - **[Feb. 2020]** Our paper about incremental learning is accepted to CVPR 2020.
